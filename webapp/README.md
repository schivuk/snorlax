**Homework 5: Extending the Social Network**
==============================

http://www.w3schools.com/ was the primary resource I used for documentation related to html, forms and making requests. https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/ref/ was the resource I used for documentation related to Django.

I used my code from Homework 4 as a base, and in Homework 4, I used the example code provided in Lecture 7 by the Professor, https://github.com/CMU-Web-Application-Development/models-example, as starter code. 

In addition, I referred to the example code provided in Lectures 9 and 10 by the professor, from https://github.com/CMU-Web-Application-Development/addrbook-example and https://github.com/CMU-Web-Application-Development/image-example as reference for template inheritance and uploading images, in particular. 

I used two resources for bootstrap templates. One for the login and register pages, and another for the global stream and profile pages. The link to the first resource is http://bootstrapzero.com/bootstrap-template/sign-in. The link to the second resource used is http://bootstrapzero.com/bootstrap-template/cerulean-theme.
